    "## Overview\n",
    "Health and Wellness is a big business. Specifically, weight loss. We’re all trying because it’s very, very hard. I recently went on my own weight loss journey, losing about 50 lbs in roughly 18 months. Weighing myself every morning, I agonized over every tenth of a lb, recording it in an app on my phone. I realized that losing big chunks of weights starts with small, incremental progress on the scale. But I didn’t stop there. As a data nerd I thought, “let’s record every meal.” So I did that too. I wondered… given all this data I have, could I predict my weight? My watch and phone captures my exercise, sleep, eating, and so much more. There must be trends here. At a minimum, I should be able to predict whether my weight will go up or down from the previous day. So let’s do it."

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "I have much (and probably too much) of this data in my iphone and Apple Watch. It contains the weight information, workouts, heart rate, meals - broken down into subcategories (proteins, fats, etc). Most importantly is the weight. That will be the feature that I primarily use for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because it’s my data, there’s more clarity about data entry methods. This is more subjective, than a controlled experiment with many participants. I know what data I was diligent about collecting so I should be able to scrub it appropriately. For instance, I didn’t record my fluids consistently - water, tea, coffee. Water consumption is a big part of this so I’ll have to be clear about the gaps in the data"

    "### Weigh-In Protocol\n",
    "The routine for entering the weigh-in was pretty basic. I recorded my weight on a 3rd party app, on the same bathroom scale, before I drank any fluids in the morning but after urination. Morning wiegh-in works well because it's a simple routine. More importantly though, you likely weight the least because you're dehydrated after a night of sleep."
